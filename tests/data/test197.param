# Mixing output on stdout and stderr results in different output on Windows
# compared to POSIX platforms. Massage the output to allow meaningful
# and practical comparisons on all platforms by Deleting the "Reading..." line
# and moving the "Warning:" line to the end.
# Unfortunately, BSD sed doesn't support grouping commands with {}.
