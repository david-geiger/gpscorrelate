TITLE='Test that --no-mtime is implied by --fix-datestamps'
# This is a strange way to test this, but I haven't found a better means that's
# both simple && highly portable. This method just compares the relative mtime
# of the file under test and a just-created file with ls -t and ensures that
# the file under test is older than the other.
#
# This makes several assumptions:
# 1) the filesystem and ls command operate at one second resolution
# 2) when two files have the same mtime, ls -t will output them in
#    lexicographic order
# The failure of either assumption is designed to cause a false negative
# result, so they should not disrupt operation of the test suite.
